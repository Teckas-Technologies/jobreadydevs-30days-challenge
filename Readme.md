# Day 25: Deployment on Heroku or GitHub Pages

Welcome to Day 25 of the Job-Ready Devs 30-Day Challenge! Today, youâ€™ll take your app live by deploying it on Heroku or GitHub Pages. Deployment allows users to access your app via the internet, making it accessible and professional.

## Objectives
1. Deploy the application live using Heroku (for full-stack apps) or GitHub Pages (for frontend-only apps).
2. Ensure the deployed app is fully functional and accessible.
3. Test the live app and resolve any deployment-specific issues.

## Steps

### Step 1: Choose a Deployment Platform
- **Heroku**: For full-stack apps with a Node.js backend.
- **GitHub Pages**: For frontend-only apps.

### Deployment on Heroku (Full-Stack Apps)

#### Step 1.1: Prepare Your App for Deployment
1. Ensure your app is production-ready:
   - Remove any hardcoded development configurations.
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., database URI).
2. Add a `start` script in your `package.json`:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
        "start": "node server.js"
    }
    ```

#### Step 1.2: Install the Heroku CLI
1. Download and install the Heroku CLI.
2. Log in to Heroku:
    ```bash
    heroku login
    ```

#### Step 1.3: Create a Heroku App
1. Create a new Heroku app:
    ```bash
    heroku create
    ```

#### Step 1.4: Add Environment Variables
1. Set up your MongoDB URI in Heroku:
    ```bash
    heroku config:set MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
    ```

#### Step 1.5: Deploy Your App
1. Push your code to Heroku:
    ```bash
    git push heroku main
    ```

2. Open your app in a browser:
    ```bash
    heroku open
    ```

### Deployment on GitHub Pages (Frontend-Only Apps)
#### Step 2.1: Prepare Your Frontend for Deployment
1. Ensure all files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) are updated and functional.  

#### Step 2.2: Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository:
- Go to your repositoryâ€™s Settings on GitHub.
- Under the Pages section, select the branch to deploy (e.g., main) and click Save.

2. Access your app:
- Your app will be live at:
`https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`

### Step 3: Test the Deployed App
1. Test all features on the live app:
- CRUD operations.
- User authentication (if applicable).
- Error handling and validation.
- Responsiveness and design.

2. Verify database connectivity (for Heroku) or API integrations (for frontend-only apps).

### Step 4: Resolve Deployment-Specific Issues
1. Check logs for errors:
- **Heroku**: Use the following command to view logs:
    ```bash
    heroku logs --tail
    ```

- **GitHub Pages**: Check the browser console for errors (e.g., missing files or incorrect paths).

2. Fix any identified issues and redeploy if necessary.

## Your Assignment Task:
- Share the deployed site URL in the comments in the [Telegram channel](https://t.me/jobreadydevs).
