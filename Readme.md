# Day 10: Express.js Basics + Creating Routes

Welcome to Day 10 of the **Job-Ready Devs 30-Day Challenge!** ðŸŽ‰ Today, youâ€™ll start building a robust backend with **Express.js**, a lightweight and flexible web framework for Node.js. By the end of this lesson, youâ€™ll be able to set up and test basic API routes to handle requests and responses for your application.

## Overview
In this lesson, youâ€™ll:

1. **Learn Express.js basics**: Understand its role in routing and handling requests.
2. **Create a /students route**: Serve dynamic data through an API.
3. **Handle custom and invalid routes**: Add flexibility and error handling to your application.  

Why Express.js?  
Express.js simplifies the process of creating and managing routes, making it the go-to framework for backend development in Node.js. Mastering it is a key step in building dynamic, API-driven web applications.

## Objectives
1. Understand how `Express.js` handles routing and middleware.
2. Create API routes for serving dynamic data.
3. Learn to handle invalid routes gracefully.

## Steps

### Step 1: Install Express.js (if not already installed)
1. Switch to the "Day-10" Branch
    - Switch to the "Day-10" branch by running the following command in the terminal
    ```bash
     git checkout Day-10
    ```

2. Open your `terminal` and navigate to your project directory.
3. If `Express.js` is not installed, add it as a dependency:
    ```bash
    npm install express
    ```

4. Open the `package.json` file to verify that express is listed as a dependency.


### Step 2: Update Your server.js File
1. Open `server.js` in your project folder.
2. Modify it to include a `/students` route:
    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();

    // Middleware to serve static files
    app.use(express.static('public'));

    // Dummy data for students
    const students = [
        { id: 1, name: 'John Doe', email: 'john.doe@example.com' },
        { id: 2, name: 'Jane Smith', email: 'jane.smith@example.com' }
    ];

    // Route to handle GET /students
    app.get('/students', (req, res) => {
        res.json(students);
    });

    // Start the server
    const PORT = 3000;
    app.listen(PORT, () => {
        console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
    });
    ```

### Step 3: Test the /students Route
1. Start the server:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

2. Visit the /students route:
    - Open your browser to navigate to:
    ```bash
    http://localhost:3000/students
    ```

3. Verify the response:
    - You should see the dummy student data displayed as a `JSON` array.


### Step 4: Add Another Route (Optional)
1. Add a new route to serve a custom response. For example, an `/about` route:
    ```javascript
    app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
        res.send('This is the Student Management App API!');
    });
    ```

2. Restart the server and test by visiting:
    ```bash
    http://localhost:3000/about
    ```

### Step 5: Handle a Not Found Route
1. Add `middleware` to handle invalid routes:
    ```javascript
    app.use((req, res) => {
        res.status(404).send('Route not found');
    });
    ```

2. Restart the server and test by visiting a non-existent route, e.g.:
    ```bash
    http://localhost:3000/invalid
    ```
    - You should see the message: "Route not found."


## Push Your Changes to GitHub
1. **Stage the changes**:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

2. **Commit the changes with a descriptive message**:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add Express.js routes including GET /students"
    ```

3. **Push the changes to your repository**:
    ```bash
    git push origin Day-10
    ```

4. **Push the final code to main branch**:
    - Upload your final code to your `GitHub` main branch:
    ```bash
    git push origin Day-10:main --force
    ```

## Amazing Work! ðŸŽ‰
Youâ€™ve successfully created your first API routes with **Express.js**. This is a major milestone in backend development! Next, weâ€™ll explore handling dynamic data with **POST** requests to allow users to add data to your app. Keep up the great work, and see you in the next lesson! ðŸš€
