# Day 8: JavaScript Event Listeners + Data Handling

Welcome to Day 8 of the **Job-Ready Devs 30-Day Challenge!** ðŸŽ‰ Today, weâ€™ll focus on making your form more interactive and dynamic using **JavaScript Event Listeners**. Youâ€™ll capture and handle user inputs seamlessly while enhancing the overall user experience.

## Expected Output 
At the end of **Day 8**, you will have knowledge of **Javascript Functions** and **Array**, and you will get an expected output like the one shown below:

## Overview
In this lesson, youâ€™ll:

1. **Master Event Listeners**: Learn how to capture and respond to user actions.
2. **Improve Form Functionality**: Add dynamic behaviors for submitting and resetting the form.
3. **Focus on Usability**: Use feedback like success messages and confirmation dialogs to make your form more user-friendly.  

Why it matters: Interactive forms are essential in every web application. Learning how to handle events effectively will help you build responsive and professional-looking user interfaces.

## Objectives
1. Use JavaScript event listeners to handle form events dynamically.
2. Validate user input and provide meaningful feedback.
3. Add confirmation dialogs and success messages for better usability.

## The confirm() Function in JavaScript
The `confirm()` function in JavaScript is used to display a dialog box with a specified message and "OK" and "Cancel" buttons. It pauses the script's execution until the user interacts with the dialog. This function is often used to prompt the user for confirmation before proceeding with an action.

### Syntax
```javascript
const result = confirm(message);
```

- `message`: A string representing the text to display in the dialog box.
- `result`: A boolean value:
    - `true` if the user clicks "OK".
    - `false` if the user clicks "Cancel".
    

## Steps
### Step 1: Add a Reset Button to the Form
1. Switch to the "Day-8" Branch
    - Switch to the "Day-8" branch by running the following command in the terminal
    ```bash
     git checkout Day-8
    ```
    
2. Open your `index.html` file.
    - Add a `reset` button to your form, below the submit button:

    ```html
    <div class="buttons">
        <button type="submit">Add Student</button>
        <button type="reset">Reset</button>
    </div>
    ```

3. Save the file and refresh your browser. You should now see the `reset` button.


### Step 2: Add Styles to the Reset Button
1. Open your `styles.css` file.
2. Add a new style for the `reset` button to distinguish it from the `submit` button. Use the attribute selector to target the `reset` button.
    ```css
    /* If the button's type is reset, set the background color to red */
    #add-student button[type="reset"] {
        background-color: rgb(218, 78, 78); /* Set background color to red for reset type */
    }
    ```

3. Save your `styles.css` file and refresh your browser. The `reset` button should now have the updated styles.


### Step 3: Add a Confirmation for the Reset Button
1. Open your `script.js` file.
2. Add an event listener to the `reset` button:
    ```javascript
    const resetButton = document.querySelector('button[type="reset"]');

    resetButton.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
        const confirmation = confirm('Are you sure you want to clear the form?');
        if (!confirmation) {
            // Prevent the reset if the user cancels
            event.preventDefault();
        }
    });
    ```

3. Save and Test:
    - Click the `reset` button, and confirm whether the form clears or not based on your response.


### Step 4: Test the Enhanced Form Functionality
1. Open your `index.html` file in a browser.
2. Test the following:
    - Fill out the form and click "Submit." Check if the student is added successfully and the form resets afterward.
    - Click "Reset" and verify that the form only clears when you confirm.


## Push Your Changes to GitHub
1. **Stage the changes**:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

2. **Commit the changes with a descriptive message**:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Enhance form functionality with submit and reset buttons"
    ```

3. **Push the changes to your repository**:
    ```bash
    git push origin Day-8
    ```

4. **Push the final code to main branch**:
    - Upload your final code to your `GitHub` main branch:
    ```bash
    git push origin Day-8:main --force
    ```
