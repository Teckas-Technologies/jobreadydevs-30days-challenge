# Day 2: HTML Basics + App Structure

Welcome to Day 2 of the **Job-Ready Devs 30-Day Challenge!** ðŸŽ‰ Today, weâ€™ll take the first major step toward building our **Student Management App** by creating its structure using HTML. By the end of this session, you'll have a solid layout for your app, complete with a navigation bar, a student list section, and a form to add new students.

## Expected Output
At the end of **Day 2**, you will have knowledge of **HTML tags**, and you will get an expected output like the one shown below:

## Overview
In this lesson, youâ€™ll:

1. Learn the fundamentals of structuring web pages with HTML.
2. Create key sections of your app using semantic HTML for better readability and accessibility.
3. Build a reusable and organized layout to prepare for the next stepsâ€”styling with CSS and adding interactivity with JavaScript.  
Remember: Learning HTML is the foundation of web development. While it may seem basic, a well-structured HTML file makes your code easier to style, maintain, and scale.


## Objectives  

1. **Master HTML basics**: Use elements like `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<ul>`, `<form>`, and more.
2. **Build a navigation bar**: Help users easily navigate your app.
3. **Create a structured layout**: Add sections for displaying and managing student information.
4. **Use semantic HTML**: Write code that's clear and meaningful for both developers and search engines.

## Steps
### Step 1: Create a New HTML File
1. Open your project root folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Switch to the "Day-2" Branch
    - Switch to the "Day-2" branch by running the following command in the terminal
    ```bash
     git checkout Day-2
    ```

3. If you donâ€™t already have an `index.html` file, create one:
    - Right-click in the file explorer, choose **New File**, and name it `index.html`.

### Step 2: Add the Basic HTML Structure
1. Every HTML document needs a basic structure. Add the following to your `index.html` file:
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Student Management App</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

2. **Why this structure matters**:
    - `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser that weâ€™re using HTML5.
    - `<html lang="en">` specifies the language of the document for better accessibility.
    - `<meta charset="UTF-8">` ensures proper rendering of special characters.
    - `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` ensures responsiveness for mobile devices.

### Step 3: Create a Navigation Bar
1. Inside the `<body>` tag, add a `<nav>` element to create a navigation bar:
    ```html
    <nav>
        <div class="logo">
            <img src="teckas-logo.jpg" alt="logo">
            <h1>Student Management</h1>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#student-list">Student List</a></li>
            <li><a href="#add-student">Add Student</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    ```

2. **Whatâ€™s happening here**:

    - `<h1>` represents the main title of your app.
    - `<ul>` creates an unordered list of navigation links.
    - `<a href="#">` is used for navigation. Links like `#student-list` allow users to jump to specific sections on the page.
    - `<div class="logo">`:
        - Acts as a container for the logo and the title.
        - Helps style both elements together.

    - `<img src="teckas-logo.jpg" alt="logo">`:
        - Displays the logo image.
        - The `src` attribute will give the `url` or `path` of the image.
        - The `alt` text provides a description of the image.

3. **Pro Tip**: Test your navigation links after adding the corresponding sections below. Clicking them will scroll to the appropriate section if the `id` matches.

### Step 4: Add a Student List Section
1. Below the `<nav>` element, add a `<section>` for displaying the student list:
    ```html
    <div class="sections">
        <section id="student-list">
            <h2>Student List</h2>
            <ul>
                <!-- Example placeholder for student names -->
                <li>John Doe</li>
                <li>Jane Smith</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
    </div>
    ```

2. **Why use a `<section>`?**

    - Sections help divide your page into logical parts, making it easier to manage and style later.
    - The id="student-list" allows linking directly to this section using the navigation bar.

3. **Whatâ€™s next?**

    - Weâ€™ll dynamically update this list with JavaScript in the coming days.


### Step 5: Create a Form for Adding Students
1. Below the student list section, add another `<section>` for the form:
    ```html
    <section id="add-student">
        <h2>Add Student</h2>
        <form>
            <label for="name">Name:</label>
            <input type="text" id="name" name="name" placeholder="Enter student name" required>
            <br>
            <label for="email">Email:</label>
            <input type="email" id="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter student email" required>
            <br>
            <button type="submit">Add Student</button>
        </form>
    </section>
    ```

2. **Form details**:

    - `<form>` creates a container for inputs and buttons.
    - `<label>` describes the input field, improving accessibility for screen readers.
    - `required` ensures users canâ€™t submit empty fields.

3. **Pro Tip**:

    - Keep your inputs simple for now. Weâ€™ll handle form submissions and validations in future lessons.

### Step 6: Footer section
1. Below the add student section, add the `<footer>` for the copyright section:
    ```html
    <footer>
        <h2>Copyright &copy; 2024. Job Ready Devs held by <a href="https://teckastechnologies.com/">Teckas Technologies!</a></h2>
    </footer>
    ```

    - `<footer>` Tag
        - The `<footer>` tag is a block-level element used to define a `footer` for a section or the entire webpage. It typically contains metadata, copyright information, or links.

    - `<h2>` Tag
        - The `<h2>` tag is a heading element used to define a subheading on a webpage. It is a block-level element and is the second largest heading in HTML after `<h1>`.

    - `<a>` Tag
        - The `<a>` tag is used to define hyperlinks. It can link to another webpage, a section within the same page, or any external resource.

        **Attributes**:
        - `href`:
            - Specifies the URL of the destination.
            - Example: href="https://teckastechnologies.com/"

        - `target` (Optional):
            - Specifies where to open the linked document (e.g., `_blank` for a new tab).
            - Example: target="_blank"
  

### Step 7: Review and Save Your Work
1. Check your file structure:

    - Does your `<body>` contain the `<nav>`, `<section id="student-list">`, and `<section id="add-student">` elements in the right order?
    - Ensure all tags are properly opened and closed.

2. Save your work using `Ctrl+S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+S` (Mac).

### Step 8: Test Your Page
1. Open `index.html` in your browser:
    - Open file explorer and `double-click` the file or drag and drop it into your browser window.

2. Verify the following:
    - The navigation bar appears at the top of the page.
    - The student list section is displayed with placeholder names.
    - The "Add Student" form appears below the student list.

3. Test navigation links:
    - Clicking on links in the navigation bar should scroll to the corresponding sections.

1. **Stage the changes**:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
2. **Commit the changes with a descriptive message**:
