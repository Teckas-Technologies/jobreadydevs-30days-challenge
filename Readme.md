# Day 20: Testing and Debugging the Application

Welcome to Day 20 of the **Job-Ready Devs 30-Day Challenge!** ðŸŽ‰ Today, weâ€™ll ensure your applicationâ€™s CRUD features work flawlessly by performing end-to-end testing and debugging. Youâ€™ll test both the frontend and backend to ensure seamless integration and fix any issues you encounter.

## Objectives
- Conduct comprehensive testing for all **CRUD operations**.
- Debug frontend and backend issues using tools like **DevTools** and **Postman**.
- Ensure the application works end-to-end, with proper integration between the frontend and backend.

## Steps

### Step 1: Test CRUD Operations in the Backend
1. Start your server:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

2. Use Postman or a similar tool to test each API route:

**POST /students**
- Valid Test:
    - Send a valid request body (e.g., { "name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane.doe@example.com" }).
    - Verify that the student is created and a 201 Created status is returned.  
- Invalid Test:
    - Test with missing or invalid fields (e.g., missing name or an invalid email).
    - Confirm the response contains meaningful error messages.

**GET /students**
- Retrieve all students and confirm the response matches the database records.

**GET /students/:id**
- Valid Test: Fetch a student using an existing ID and verify the response.
- Invalid Test: Use a non-existent or invalid ID and ensure a 404 Not Found error is returned.

**PUT /students/:id**
- Valid Test: Update a studentâ€™s details (e.g., name and email) and confirm the changes are reflected.
- Invalid Test: Send invalid data and ensure the validation rules are enforced.

**DELETE /students/:id**
- Valid Test: Delete an existing student and verify they are removed.
- Invalid Test: Attempt to delete a non-existent student and confirm the appropriate error response.

### Step 2: Test Frontend CRUD Operations
1. Open your app in a browser.
2. Test the following:

**Add Student**
- Enter valid data in the form and verify the student appears in the list.
- Test invalid inputs (e.g., empty fields or duplicate emails) and check for error messages.

**Edit Student**
- Click the Edit button for a student and update their details.
- Ensure the student list reflects the changes and validations are enforced.

**Delete Student**
- Click the Delete button for a student and confirm the deletion.
- Verify that the student is removed from the list.

**Fetch Students**
- Refresh the page and ensure all students are loaded correctly.

### Step 3: Debug Issues
**Frontend Debugging**
1. Open the browserâ€™s DevTools (usually `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
2. Check the Console tab for JavaScript errors.
3. Use the Network tab to inspect API requests:
- Ensure the correct endpoints are called with valid data.
- Check response statuses (200 OK, 400 Bad Request, etc.).
4. Fix issues in your JavaScript (e.g., Fetch API logic or event listeners).

**Backend Debugging**
1. Check the terminal for error logs when running the server.
2. Add `console.log()` statements to debug backend logic:
    ```javascript
    console.log('Request body:', req.body);
    console.log('Student ID:', req.params.id);
    ```

3. Use Postman to isolate backend issues and verify responses.


### Step 4: Test Database Operations
1. Open your MongoDB client (e.g., MongoDB Compass or CLI).
2. Verify database changes for each CRUD operation:
- **Create**: New students are added with the correct fields.
- **Read**: All students can be fetched.
- **Update**: Changes are reflected in the database.
- **Delete**: Removed students no longer appear in the database.

### Step 5: Verify End-to-End Functionality
1. Start the server and open the app in a browser.
2. Perform a complete end-to-end test:
  - Add a new student.
  - Fetch the updated student list.
  - Edit the studentâ€™s details.
  - Delete the student.
3. Confirm that the frontend and backend integration works flawlessly.

## Your Assignment Task:
1. Verify the functionality by performing the steps above in your own environment.
2. Share your feedback or any improvements you suggest in the Telegram channel comments.
