# Day 11: Working with JSON Data + Building the Student API

Welcome to Day 11 of the **Job-Ready Devs 30-Day Challenge!** ðŸŽ‰ Today, weâ€™ll create a fully functional **Student API** to serve JSON data. This will allow your frontend to fetch and display dynamic student information, bringing your application closer to real-world functionality.

## Expected Output 
At the end of **Day 11**, you will have knowledge of **GET the JSON data by unique ID** and **Fetch JSON data from frontend** and you will get an expected output like the one shown below:

## Overview
In this lesson, youâ€™ll:

1. **Learn to serve JSON data**: Use Express.js to send structured data from the backend.
2. **Build API endpoints**: Create routes to fetch all students and individual student details.
3. **Integrate with the frontend**: (Optional) Dynamically load data from your API into the application.  

Why JSON?
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the most commonly used data format for APIs. Understanding how to work with JSON is a core skill for any developer building modern web applications.

## Objectives
1. Create an API to serve student data in JSON format.
2. Implement dynamic routes to fetch individual student records.
3. Prepare for frontend-backend integration with real-time data retrieval.

## Explanation of the Day-11 code

- **parseInt()**: Converts a string to an integer. Used to parse route parameters or user input.  
- **find()**: Searches an array and returns the first element that matches the condition.  
- **json()**: Converts data into `JSON` format (used in responses and promises).  
- **status()**: Sets the HTTP status code for a response (e.g., `200` for success, `404` for not found).  
- **fetch()**: It is a built-in JavaScript function used to make HTTP requests to servers. It is often used to retrieve data or send data to a server via endpoints. It returns a Promise, which resolves to a Response object representing the response to the request.  
- **then()**: It is a method available on a Promise that allows you to define a callback function to handle the resolved value of the Promise. For example, when a `fetch()` call is successful, `then()` can be used to process and use the returned response. It also allows chaining multiple steps after a successful response.  
- **catch()**: It is a method available on a Promise to handle errors or rejections in the Promise chain. If any step in the Promise chain (like `fetch()` or `then()`) fails, `catch()` provides a way to execute a callback function with the error. This ensures that unexpected issues, like network failures, are properly handled.  
- **error**: Represents an `error` that occurred (e.g., during fetch or processing).  

## Steps
### Step 1: Update the /students Endpoint
1. Switch to the "Day-11" Branch
    - Switch to the "Day-11" branch by running the following command in the terminal
    ```bash
     git checkout Day-11
    ```

2. Open your `server.js` file.
3. Ensure you have dummy student data or add the following:
    ```javascript
    // Array of student objects with id, name, and email
    const students = [
        { id: 1, name: 'John Doe', email: 'john.doe@example.com' },
        { id: 2, name: 'Jane Smith', email: 'jane.smith@example.com' },
        { id: 3, name: 'Sam Wilson', email: 'sam.wilson@example.com' }
    ];
    ```

4. Modify the `/students` route to return the student data as JSON:
    ```javascript
    // Route to get all students
    app.get('/students', (req, res) => {
        res.json(students); // Send the array of students as a JSON response
    });
    ```

5. Save the file.


### Step 2: Test the /students Endpoint
1. Start your server:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

2. Use a browser or API testing tool like Postman to send a GET request to:
    ```bash
    http://localhost:3000/students
    ```

3. Verify that the response is the student data in JSON format:
    ```json
    [
        { "id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com" },
        { "id": 2, "name": "Jane Smith", "email": "jane.smith@example.com" },
        { "id": 3, "name": "Sam Wilson", "email": "sam.wilson@example.com" }
    ]
    ```

### Step 3: Add a Route to Serve a Single Student
1. Add a new route to retrieve a student by their ID:
    ```javascript
    // Route to get a student by ID
    app.get('/students/:id', (req, res) => {
        const studentId = parseInt(req.params.id); // Convert the id from the request parameter to an integer
        const student = students.find(s => s.id === studentId); // Search for the student with the matching id

        if (student) {
            res.json(student); // Send the matched student data as JSON
        } else {
            res.status(404).json({ error: 'Student not found' }); // Send a 404 response if no student is found
        }
    });
    ```

2. Save the file and restart the server:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

### Step 4: Test the /students/:id Endpoint
1. Send a `GET` request to:
    ```bash
    http://localhost:3000/students/1
    ```

2. Verify the response:
    ```json
    { "id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com" }
    ```

3. Test an invalid ID (e.g., /students/999) and confirm that the server responds with:
    ```json
    { "error": "Student not found" }
    ```


### Step 5: Integrate with the Frontend - (Optional)
1. Open `script.js` and add a fetch request to retrieve the student data:
    ```javascript
    // Fetch all students from the server
    fetch('/students')
        .then(response => response.json()) // Parse the JSON data from the server response
        .then(data => {
            console.log(data);  // Log the student data to the console
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.error('Error fetching students:', error); // Log an error if the fetch fails
        });
    ```

2. Save the file and open your browserâ€™s `console` to verify that the student data is being fetched.


## Push Your Changes to GitHub
1. **Stage the changes**:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

2. **Commit the changes with a descriptive message**:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add JSON data endpoints for students"
    ```

3. **Push the changes to your repository**:
    ```bash
    git push origin Day-11
    ```

4. **Push the final code to main branch**:
    - Upload your final code to your `GitHub` main branch:
    ```bash
    git push origin Day-11:main --force
    ```

## Great Job! ðŸŽ‰
Youâ€™ve built a fully functional Student **API** that serves JSON data and handles dynamic routes. This is a critical step in building interactive, data-driven applications. Keep up the amazing workâ€”tomorrow, weâ€™ll add the ability to create and update data via **POST** and **PUT** requests. ðŸš€
